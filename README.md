Repository for Team Braintrust's eIDEAS project (ENSE 885AS Spring/Summer 2018).

Documents:

* [Requirements](./requirements.md)
* [Discussion](./discussions.md)
* Latest Mockups: \[[Balsamiq File (.bmpr)](./mockups/eideas.bmpr)\], \[[PDF - clean](./mockups/eideas.pdf)\] , \[[PDF - with linking hints](./mockups/eideas_with_link_hints.pdf)\]

**About this Project**

The eIDEAS project was requested by eHealth with the goal to improve the quality of healthcare across the province of Saskatchewan. This follows the organization's ongoing efforts to foster an internal culture of innovation. Using Plan, Do, Evaluate, Adapt (PDEA) cycles the goal is to improve quality, cost, delivery, safety, and engagement (QCDSE).

These goals are accomplished by providing an application for employees to submit ideas for improving existing organizational processes. This increases visibility of individual and collaborative work.

This project has been signed/approved by eHealth Saskatchewan and the University of Regina.

**Info for Newcomers**

The discussion document is a good place to start in order to become familiar with the project. We recommend flipping between both the [discussion](./discussions.md) and [requirements](./requirements.md) documents as needed, since they frequently reference each other.

To get a good understanding of the application flow, we recommend using the Balsamiq project file. Open [eideas.bmpr](./mockups/eideas.bmpr) in Balsamiq and select Full Screen Presentation (or press `CTRL+F`). Balsamiq can be used via the [cloud](https://balsamiq.cloud/), or it can be downloaded [here](https://balsamiq.com/download/).

If you do not wish to use Balsamiq, we provide two PDF options. Both are fully interactive with clickable elements:

* [PDF - clean](./mockups/eideas.pdf) (no hints --- use this option to view the application as intended)
* [PDF - with linking hints](./mockups/eideas_with_link_hints.pdf) (hints --- this option displays all clickable elements and links in red)

We recommend going through the PDF with hints first, then switch to the clean (no hints) version once you are familiar.
