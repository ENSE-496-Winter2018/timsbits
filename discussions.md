## Potential Problems

### PCDA status movement

#### [Problem 1] Management bottleneck w.r.t. processing ideas

**Description:** Managers may be overburdened by the amount of ideas they have to process if they must move the PDCA status for every idea for each team they manage.

**Solution:** Emphasize somewhere (e.g. About eIDEAS pop-up on homepage) that Managers are not required to process every single idea submitted. Suggest that they process some number of ideas per week (e.g. 5 per week). These ideas can be selected at the Manager's discretion (suggestion: choose "top ideas" as ranked by Score).
