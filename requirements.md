## 1 Introduction
The system requested by eHealth with the goal to improve the quality of healthcare across the province. This follows the organization's ongoing efforts to foster an internal culture of innovation. Using Plan, Do, Evaluate, Adapt (PDEA) cycles the goal is to improve quality, cost, delivery, safety, and engagement (QCDSE).

The proposed project accomplishes this by providing an application for employees to submit their ideas for improving existing organizational processes.  This increases visibility of individual and collaborative work.

**Notice:** PDCA (**P**lan **D**o **C**heck **A**ct) has been substituted by PDEA (**P**lan **D**o **E**valuate **A**dapt). See [Discussion](./discussions.md) document.

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a backbone reference for the development of the eIDEAS project. The below sections are intended to provide a list of specific functional requirements that can lead to a minimum viable product.

### 1.2 Scope
The scope of this document is to provide enough information to the group so that they have a good starting point for their work during Phase 2.

### 1.3 References
Refer to [UR Courses](https://urcourses.uregina.ca)  project requirement documentation.

Also refer to the [Discussion Document](./discussions.md).

### 1.4 Assumptions
 * The project will be under MIT license.
 * Balsamiq is used to creating mockup screens.
 * Vue.js will be used.
 * Source code and related documents will be hosted on a public [GitHub](https://github.com/rstancu/braintrust).

## 2 Methodology
Using Balsamiq, mockups for the envisioned project were created. Each mockup screen helps to identify a piece of the functionality for the whole project.

**TL;DR**
Take mockups and break them down into individual requirements (1 sentence each), then put them into a table.
